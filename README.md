# weatherDashboard
An easy way to find out what the weather is like in any city! Begin your search by typing in the city you want to find the weather for into the text box and hitting the blue search button. Within the section surrounded by the black border, you will see the city's name that you searched, the current date, an icon that represents what the weather is like, the average temperature for the day, current wind speed, humidity, and UV Index. Pay attention to the UV index color, if its green go out and enjoy the sun, if its yellow you can still enjoy the sun however I would suggest wearing sunscreen.  If the background is red, you probably want as minimal exposure to the sun as possible.

Below the current weather information you will see the forecasted weather information for the next five days. Within each forecasted day, you will see the date for that day, an icon representing what the weather might look like for that day, the average temperature, wind speed, and humidity for that day. After you search a city, a button with that city's name will appear on the page below the search button (search history section). This allows you to easily go back to city's that you had previously searched by just clicking on that city's name. 

This page uses two APIs from openweathermap.org, the first being One Call API which is used to get the weather information for the current and forecasted days. The second one is the geocoding API which is used to get latitude and longitude coordinates for the city that was searched. Moment.js was also used for displaying the current and forecasted dates.
